# PowerGenerationTriggers

PowerGenerationTriggers is a Timberborn mod that allows you to link a Power Wheel to a Gravity Battery for automated control.

# Usage

To use the mod go to a Power Wheel and link it to a Gravity Battery.
When the Gravity Battery charge goes below 25% the Power Wheel will be enabled and when the charge goes above 75% the Power Wheel will be disabled.

Future versions are gonna add configurations and support for Engine.

# Issues

If there's a warning message in the log about a missing JSON property on game launch, delete the config file and restart the game to recreate it.
